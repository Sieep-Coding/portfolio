  about: {
    description: `ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Nick Stambaugh, and I have over 4 years of experience as an analyst/developer. I've built solutions for manufacturing, healthcare, and economic development organizations. My long-term objective is to strategically lead the user experience of business-critical applications, working with like-minded free-thinkers who do what they love. Outside of coding, I love to go for long runs and be outside with my dog, relax in a hammock, occasionally write about tech I find interesting, discover new literature to discuss with my father, play video games, and spend as much time as I can with friends and family.
